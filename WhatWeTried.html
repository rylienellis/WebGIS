<div id="AGOLTimeAware" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>ArcGIS Online: Time Aware</h3>
    <p class="tabcontenttext">Brief overview of the software/configurable app that was used.</p>
    <h4>User Experience:</h4>
    <p class="tabcontenttext">When attempting to load the time series as a feature service within ArcGIS Online, only some portions of the polygon dataset would load, for unknown reasons.  Had to correctly format the dates and then export as a shapefile in order for ArcGIS Online to be able to recognize and set the time series.  Had to do some configuring with the web app but for some reason ArcGIS online formats dates oddly and I'm not sure why. Web app needs more configuration in terms of slow rendering speeds/date configuration.</p>
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">relatively easy to configure and customize with a drop-down menu for each year of data</li>
    </ul> 
    <h4>Cons:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">slow to render polygons</li>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">limits options to ESRI's suite of products</li>
    </ul> 
    <h4>Future Possibilities:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">explore additional time changes within the code itself</li>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">add contextal information for the dates instead of just a legend</li>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">add i-frames to the website to integrate the application</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div id="AGOLDashboard" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>ArcGIS Online: Dashboard</h3>
  <p class="tabcontenttext">Brief overview of the software/configurable app that was used.</p>
  <h4>User Experience:</h4>
  <p class="tabcontenttext">Wanted to explore other means of delivery through ESRI aside from the time series noted earlier.  AGOL Dashboard offered a way to import a web map and add supplementary data and widgets to further enhance the web map.  This product provided an easy way to configure the view, however, if this delivery method is selected, more time needs to be spent configuring a working layout. Dashboard allowed for manual filtering (using a drop-down menu) based on the data within the web map.  Category selectors were able to highlight the data belonging to each census year and only display that year's data on the map.  Additionally, graphs and charts can be added to further supplement the web map.  The next steps for this form of delivery would be to further explore the widgets that could be used, as well as embedding the dashboard in a webpage.</p>
  <img src="images/DashboardFinal.jpg" alt="Screenshot of finished ArcGIS dashboard showing drop down menu for user to select year of interest" class="imgFit">
  <h4>Pros:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">easy to configure</li>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">easy to display web map(s)</li>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">additional widgets can be added</li>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">potential to be embedded in webpages</li>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">customizable layout</li>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">user can manually filter data by year using the dropdown (seen on left side)</li>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">pop ups available to display additional information</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Cons:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">not a great deal of customization in terms of stylization</li>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">filtering of data by year must be done manually with the dropdown</li>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">need to refine dataset to ensure that popups make sense, or disable them altogether</li>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">slow to render polygons</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Future Possibilities:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">explore additional widgets that may improve user experience</li>
    <li class="tabcontenttext">explore using Time-Aware map from above in the map frame</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="Mapbox" class="tabcontent">   
    <h3>Mapbox</h3>
    <p class="tabcontenttext">Mapbox is a world-renowned open-source software that is used by recognized organizations such as Ancestry, the Weather Company, Facebook, Lonely Planet, Tableau and the list goes on.  Mapbox is a location data platform for both developers and designers and is available anywhere around the world with live updates happening every minute. A simple way to understand the Mapbox platform is to compare it to a pile of Lego blocks that users can use to assemble various web configurations to achieve their needs and tell their story.</p>
    <h4>User Experience:</h4>
    <p class="tabcontenttext">The goal in mind when exploring this option was to configure a readily available template for generating a time slider.  This appeared to be a relatively straightforward template to configure, but upon further inspection, it became apparent that it in fact requires a lot of configuration that we struggled to wrap our heads around.</p>
    <p class="tabcontenttext">We began by publishing the income layer to AGOL from ArcGIS Pro, once with time enabled on the layer, and once without.  From there, we began our adventure of attempting to dissect the Mapbox template of interest.  We had a difficult time configuring the code to display our map layers, as geoJSON is hard to understand as variables when there are so many for each electoral riding. We attempted to query the layers to represent a single year (Where YEAR = 2011) to draw the geoJSON into the time series web application. This integration method proved unsuccessful and requires further exploration (perhaps with a hosted service on ArcGIS Server).</p>
    <p class="tabcontenttext">After dedicating many hours toward sorting out the variables in the code and deciphering how to integrate our service, we determined that it was not worth pouring more time into.  While this was a bit of a hard pill to swallow (we are very stubborn), this was the best decision for us, as we were starting to lean toward using ArcGIS.</p>
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">ideal outcome as shown in <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/timeline-animation/?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=sem|google|brand|chko-googlesearch-pr01-dynamicsearchcampaign-nb.broad-all-landingpage-search&utm_term=brand&utm_content=chko-googlesearch-pr01-dynamicsearchcampaign-nb.broad-all-landingpage-search&gclid=CjwKCAjwvOHzBRBoEiwA48i6Amgs-mnAWEnVepHPlhsupkTx0BZHkhz2r6KC7ZC88d0wn-IGWATngBoCpW4QAvD_BwE">this template</a> is clean/simple, which is what we were aiming for</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cons:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">difficult to configure (did not continue to pursue this option, as it was consuming too much time with little to no real progress)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Future Possibilities:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">explore the possibility of first publishing the service on a server and calling it that way</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div id="Leaflet" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Leaflet</h3>
    <p class="tabcontenttext">Leaflet is an open source JavaScript library that is available for download at only 38KB for the current 1.7 version library. Its configuration ability is simple and can be enhanced with many other open and non-open source web applications such as Mapbox, OpenStreetMap, and ESRI suite. This application is growing in popularity throughout the web development community since it has tons of documentation written for tutorials, additional plugins, and source code references. Although this plethora of resources indicates it is easily navigated and readable, I can assure you -  it is not. In fact, there are so many different rabbit holes you can fall down trying to find a solution to your problem that you forget what you were looking for in the first place.</p>
    <h4>User Experience:</h4>
    <p class="tabcontenttext">The primary exploration was first to load average income data as unique values assigned as low income, middle income, and high income to represent a choropleth map. This was easily configured using a hosted feature service from ArcGIS Online. However, the cartography using Leaflet is not very appealing or easily configurable and can be seen in the figure (HERE).</p>
    <p class="tabcontenttext">The next step was to explore the time series aspect for our problem statement. Creating a web application through Leaflet was easy using the ESRI_Leaflet plugin that allowed us to use published services from ArcGIS Online without converting file types. This plugin also offered a visualizing time from a feature layer - however the application was not user friendly for our purposes of displaying a choropleth map of different years and so it was abandoned.  There were few other configurations that could use a time series aspect. However, none accomplished our primary goals of having a user-friendly application.</p>
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">easy to configure</li>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">good adaptability for symbology</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cons:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">not a sleek design</li>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">very slow rendering of polygons for large datasets</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Future Possibilities:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">explore various repositories for source code relating to time series</li>
      <li class="tabcontenttext">improve symbology for outlines and transparency</li>
    </ul>
