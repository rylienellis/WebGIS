  <h2>Ideal</h2>
  <p>A mapping application that shows changes in food bank usage over time for a span of four years.</p>
  <p><i>Note: Due to food bank usage not becoming available in time, a proof of concept was developed using average income data from Statistics Canada.</i></p>

  <h2>Reality</h2>
  <p>The current Feed Ontario map displays a single snapshot of 2018 food bank usage by electoral riding. It is therefore unable to communicate how usage changes over time, which is crucial to understanding the issue of food insecurity. </p>

  <h2>Consequences</h2>
  <p>If changes are not made to demonstrate how food bank usage varies over time, it will be difficult to determine the long-term efficacy of initiatives, or conversely, to shed light on areas of the province where food security is becoming a more serious issue over time.</p>

  <h2>Proposal</h2>
  <p>This project will focus on creating a user-friendly time series application that will show how food bank usage has changed over the four years where data exists.</p>
