  <h2>Ideal</h2>
  <p>A map that allows the user to see differences in food bank usage over time (by month) for a span of four years.</p>
  <p>Note: If food bank usage data does not become available in time, a proof of concept will be developed using average after-tax personal income data from Statistics Canada.</p>

  <h2>Reality</h2>
  <p>The current Feed Ontario map displays food bank usage by electoral riding in 2018 as a single snapshot, therefore does not allow the user to see when spikes or drops in usage may have occurred, and it also lacks the ability to show whether there have been any overall increases or decreases in usage.</p>

  <h2>Consequences</h2>
  <p>If changes are not made to demonstrate how food bank usage varies over time, it will be difficult to determine the long-term efficacy of initiatives, or conversely, to shed light on areas of the province where food security is becoming a more serious issue over time.</p>

  <h2>Proposal</h2>
  <p>This project will focus on creating a user-friendly time series application that will show how food bank usage has changed over the four years where data exists.</p>
